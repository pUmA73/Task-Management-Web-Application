# Task-Management-Web-Application
## About The Project

The Task Manager MVC Web Application is a sophisticated, web-based tool designed to simplify task management and boost productivity for both individual users and teams. By employing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, this application ensures a clean separation of concerns, making it easier for developers to work on and maintain the system.

### Core Features:

- **Task Management**: At the heart of the application is its ability to allow users to create, manage, and track tasks with ease. Users can specify details such as task descriptions, deadlines, and statuses, offering a comprehensive view of ongoing projects and daily tasks.

- **Categorization and Filtering**: With built-in categorization and filtering capabilities, users can organize tasks into projects or categories and filter them based on various criteria such as priority, deadline, or custom tags. This feature enables users to focus on what's important, enhancing their efficiency and productivity.

- **Collaboration and Sharing**: Designed with teams in mind, the application supports collaborative features allowing users to assign tasks to team members. 

- **User Authentication and Authorization**: Security is paramount in the Task Manager MVC Web Application. It includes a robust user authentication system, ensuring that tasks and project details are kept confidential and accessible only to authorized users. User roles and permissions can be defined, allowing for fine-grained control over who can view or edit tasks.
